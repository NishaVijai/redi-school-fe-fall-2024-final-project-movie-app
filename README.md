## ReDI-FE-Fall-2024-movie-details-api-search-app
This web application allows users to search for movies and save their favorites with ease. By entering a movie name into the built-in search field, the app fetches real-time data from The Open Movie Database (OMDb) API, retrieving detailed information such as the title, release year, genre, language, plot, and more. It offers a simple and efficient way to explore and organize your favorite filmsâ€”all in one place. Built entirely with vanilla JavaScript and no external frameworks, the app is lightweight, responsive, and a solid example of clean, functional front-end development.
